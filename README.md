# ControllerOverlays
Controller overlays for RetroSpy and simmilar tools

The goal is to make as many highres photos of controllers as possible for overlays on video or simmilar usecases.
It's especially important to me to get many uncommon ones and also to scale and center them uniformly so it's just a one time setup.
